# Postgres Database Required Fixes and Updates

Due to a recent Postgres update, we need to make a change to our environment variables.

Add the following to your docker-compose.yml file in the **postgres** service:

```sh
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:latest"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password
```

```sh
docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build
```

Please note, all of these changes are reflected in the downloadable checkpoint zip files.
