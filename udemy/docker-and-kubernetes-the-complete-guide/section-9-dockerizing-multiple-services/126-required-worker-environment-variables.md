# Required Worker Environment Variables

In the next lecture, we will be adding a client and worker service. There is one required configuration update that needs to be made:

1) **When adding the "Worker" service, include the Redis host and port as environment variables**:

```sh
  worker:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./worker
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./worker:/app
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Otherwise, you will get a ***"Calculated Nothing Yet"*** error message.
