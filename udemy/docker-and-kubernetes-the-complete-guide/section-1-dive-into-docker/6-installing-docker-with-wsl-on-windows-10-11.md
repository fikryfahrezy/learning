# Installing Docker with WSL on Windows 10/11

his note will provide detailed steps and instructions to install Docker and signup for a DockerHub account on Windows with WSL. We will need a DockerHub account so that we can pull images and push the images we will build.

Windows 10 & 11 users will be able to install Docker Desktop if their computer supports the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Register for a DockerHub account

Visit the link below to register for a DockerHub account (this is free)

https://hub.docker.com/signup

2. Download and install all pending Windows OS updates

3. Run the WSL install script

*Note - If you have previously enabled WSL and installed a distribution you may skip to **step #7***

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: `wsl --install` This will enable and install all required features as well as install Ubuntu.

Official documentation:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command

4. Reboot your computer

5. Set a Username and Password in Ubuntu

After the reboot, Windows will auto-launch your new Ubuntu OS and prompt you to set a username and password.

6. Manually Installing a Distribution

If for some reason Windows did not prompt you to create a distribution or you simply would like to create a new one, you can do so by running the following command: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`

7. Install Docker Desktop

Navigate to the Docker Desktop installation page and click the Docker Desktop for Windows button:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

8. Double-click the Docker Desktop Installer from your Downloads folder

9. Click "Install anyway" if warned the app isn't Microsoft-verified

10. Click "OK" to Add a shortcut to the Desktop

11. Click "Close" when you see Installation succeeded message

12. Double-click the Docker Desktop icon on your Desktop

13. Accept the Docker Service Agreement

14. Docker Desktop will launch for the first time

Docker Desktop will launch and present you with a tutorial. You are free to skip this.

15. Ensure that WSL Integration is Enabled

In Docker Desktop, click the Settings **Gear** icon. Then choose **Resources**, and finally **WSL Integration**. Make sure that the **Enable Integration with my default WSL distro** is checked. Also, if you are using multiple distributions, make sure that these additional distros are toggled on:

16. Open your Distro

Using the Windows Search feature in the toolbar, type the name of your distribution (by default it is Ubuntu) and click **Open:**

17. Check that Docker is working

Using the terminal for your distro, run the `docker` command. If all is well you should see some helpful instructions in the output similar to below:

18. Log in to Docker

Using the terminal for your distro, run the `docker login` command. You will be prompted to enter the username and password (or your Personal Access Token) you created earlier when registering for a DockerHub account. Once you see **Login Succeeded**, the setup is complete and you are free to continue to the next lecture.

## Appendix

A significant difference when using WSL is that you will need to create and run your project files from within the Linux filesystem, not the Windows filesystem. This will be very important in later lectures when we cover volumes.

You can access your Linux system by using the Windows Search feature in the toolbar and typing the name of your distribution (by default it is Ubuntu) and clicking open (see step #16 above).  This terminal should automatically open to the home directory on the Linux filesystem

Going forward, all Docker commands should be run within **WSL** and not on the Windows file system
